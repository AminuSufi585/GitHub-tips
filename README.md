# GitHub-tips
The purpose of this repo is to host tips in using GitHub and Git by and for the Chingu Otters cohort.

It is also a means to practice GitHub workflows using a simple markdown file (this one). This could also be done using a [GitHub wiki](https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-wikis/) but the workflows are different so we'll just use this README.md file and some images Ã  la the [Open Guide to AWS](https://github.com/open-guides/og-aws).

## Note from Original Author

I am very new to learning all of these GitHub workflows myself so both patience and corrections are very much welcome! -[Josh Morel](https://github.com/joshmorel) 

## Organization Structure

Note: Much of this is distilled from the [information provided here] (https://help.github.com/categories/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/)

### Organization and Roles

We started by creating an organization for [our cohort](https://github.com/orgs/chingu-otters). All members who requested access were added with the **Member** role. With the **Member** role, you can:

1. Create repos
1. Create teams and be made a team maintainer
1. See all members and teams
1. Create or delete project board and edit description 

There is also a **Owner** role who can invite and delete members, add billing information and delete the organization. My plan is to give active members the **Owner** role.

### Teams and Organization repos

As mentioned previously all team members have the ability to create organization repos. They then have the ability to change permissions on that [repo for different users](https://help.github.com/articles/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization/#changing-repository-settings]) so that specific people can collaborate.

To create a repo simply click on the **Repositories** tab then click **New**:

To streamline and better organize permissions on a repo there are **Teams**.

TODO: Add instructions on creating team and transfering repo to team.
